# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End  ## My Task My task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Iâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.   Database Models * Category     * id         * Integer         * Doesn't allow null values         * Set as primary key         * Uses auto increment     * category_name         * String         * Doesn't allow null values * Product     * id         * Integer         * Doesn't allow null values         * Set as primary key         * Uses auto increment     * product_name         * String         * Doesn't allow null values     * price         * Decimal         * Doesn't allow null values         * Validates that the value is a decimal     * stock         * Integer         * Doesn't allow null values         * Set a default value of 10         * Validates that the value is numeric     * category_id         * Integer         * References the category model's id * Tag     * id         * Integer         * Doesn't allow null values         * Set as primary key         * Uses auto increment     * tag_name         * String * ProductTag     * id         * Integer         * Doesn't allow null values         * Set as primary key         * Uses auto increment     * product_id         * Integer         * References the product model's id     * tag_id         * Integer         * References the tag model's id         *   Data Associations You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them: * Product belongs to Category, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category. * Category has many Product models. * Product belongs to many Tag models. Using the ProductTag through model, allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products. * Tag belongs to many Product models.
